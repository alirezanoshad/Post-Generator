            <h1 id="title">The World of <br> Charles & Ray Emaes</h1>
            <span id="createDate">30 September 2021</span>

            <p id="firstP">With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into careers that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture, clean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>
            <img src="./Docs/dsw-eames-dining-chair.jpg" alt="overall image" id="firstImg  mainImg">
            <p id="secondP">That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and includes the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>
            <p id="thirdP">Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better? Will we have "serious fun" doing it?</p>
            <span id="quote">“Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely, & to the best of your ability, & <br>that way, you might change the world.”</span>
            <span id="quoteAuthor">— Charles Eames</span>
            <p id="forthP">They loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and function. "The details are not details," Charles said. "They make the product."</p>
            <p id="fifthP">A problem-solver who encouraged experimentation among his staff, Charles once said his dream was "to have people working on useless projects. These have the germ of new concepts."</p>

            </div>
            <p id="sixthP">Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration," he said, "a kind of 30-year flash."</p>
            <p id="seventhP">With these two, one thing always seemed to lead to another. Their revolutionary work in moulded plywood led to their breakthrough work in moulded fibreglass seating. A magazine contest led to their highly innovative "Case Study" house. Their love of photography led to film making, including a huge seven-screen presentation at the Moscow World's Fair in 1959, in a dome designed by their friend and colleague, Buckminster Fuller.</p>
            <p id="eighthP">Graphic design led to showroom design, toy collecting to toy inventing. And a wooden plank contraption for taking naps, rigged by their friend, director Billy Wilder, led to their acclaimed chaise lounge design.</p>
            <p id="ninethP">A design critic once said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place." That they did. They also made it a lot more interesting.</p>
